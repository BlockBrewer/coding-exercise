# Business Questionnaire Application

This project is a React-based business questionnaire application. It's built using a boilerplate from [react-vite-ts-jest-boilerplate](https://github.com/solarmia/react-vite-ts-jest-boilerplate).

## About

This application guides users through a series of business-related questions, adapting the flow based on their responses. It's designed to demonstrate React component structuring, state management, and TypeScript integration.

## Installation
npm install

## Running the Application
npm run dev

## Known Issues

The following issues are known and acknowledged. They are left as-is for demonstration purposes but would be addressed in a production environment:

1. **State Management**: Currently relies on local component state. A more robust solution like Redux or Context API would be implemented for production.

2. **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests are not yet implemented.

3. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support are not fully implemented.

4. **Error Handling**: Error boundaries and robust error handling mechanisms are not in place.

5. **Internationalization**: The app currently doesn't support multiple languages.

6. **Performance Optimizations**: Code splitting and lazy loading are not implemented.

7. **Styling**: Some inline styles are used instead of a more maintainable styling solution.

8. **Type Safety**: Some areas could benefit from stricter TypeScript typing.

9. **CI/CD**: No automated build and deployment processes are set up.

10. **Documentation**: Comprehensive component and function documentation is lacking.

11. **API Error Handling**: Strategies for dealing with API failures or timeouts are not implemented.

12. **Analytics and Logging**: User behavior tracking and error logging are not in place.

13. **Scalability**: Question logic is tightly coupled with component structure.

14. **Security Measures**: Input sanitization and protection against common web vulnerabilities are not implemented.

These issues would be addressed in a production-ready version of the application.
